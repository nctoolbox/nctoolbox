Brief summary:

  I. Prequisites

  1. Matlab R2008a+.  You can verify the version of Matlab by typing:
       >> version
  2. Java 6+.  You can verify the version of Java used by Matlab by typing: 
       >>  version('-java'). 
     The version returned should start with 'Java 1.6'. 
     If it starts with 'Java 1.5' you can try updating the Matlab JVM:

     or use the older nctoolbox-20091112 version of this toolbox.

 II. Setup

  1. In Matlab, change to the nctoolbox directory. For example,
       >> cd ~/Documents/MATLAB/nctoolbox
  2. Run the setup_nctoolbox.m function
       >> setup_nctoolbox
  3. This sets up nctoolbox for the current Matlab session only.
     You need to add the 'setup_nctoolbox' command to your startup.m file if you
     want it configured every time you start Matlab. 
      
III. Demos

  1. Demos that display basic functionality are in the 'demos' subdirectory.  These demos
     can fail if the machines serving the remote data access URLs are unavailable.
  2. Contributed demos that display additional or specialized functionality are in 
     the demos/contrib directory.  Some of these depend on accessing remote sites for
     data that can be less reliable than the data URLs in the 'demos' directory.
